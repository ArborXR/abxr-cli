# ArborXR CLI

This CLI tool provides commands for managing apps and files via the ArborXR API. The tool is organized into command groups: apps and files. Each group has several subcommands to perform specific operations through the command line.

## Prerequisites

Before using the CLI tool, ensure you have the following:
* Python 3 installed on your system.
* An API Token for authentication. See this Knowledge Base article for how to generate an API token: https://help.arborxr.com/en/articles/8858544-public-api-v2
* Setting the API token via:
    * The environment variable ABXR_API_TOKEN (or the alternative ARBORXR_ACCESS_TOKEN), or
    * The command line option --token.

## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/arborxr/abxr-cli.git
cd abxr-cli
```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
For best practices, create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```
*On Windows virtual environment is activated differently*
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Build and Install
Run the build script to compile the necessary components, then install the CLI tool using the install script:

```
./build.sh
./install.sh
```

Following these steps will ensure you have a clean, isolated environment you can execute the CLI in.

## Global Options

`-u, --url`
* Description: API Base URL

`-t, --token`

* Default: Value of ABXR_API_TOKEN (or ARBORXR_ACCESS_TOKEN)

`-f, --format`
* Description: Data output format
